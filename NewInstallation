Before star installing anything, install these

sudo apt-get install autoconf
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev

And then install the dependencies
./depend/install_deps

Install opencl library of nvidia
sudo apt-get install nvidia-opencl-dev
sudo apt-get install nvidia-opencl-icd-331
sudo apt-get install nvidia-current

There is a bug with the version 1.2 of OpenCl, therefore we have to use the headers of the version 1.1 (https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/) and change the headers manually to /usr/include/CL
