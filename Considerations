1. Install and run the package libfreenect that uses libOpenCL because we need the ROS bridge

2. Install OpenCL:
According to the GPU or integrated graphic card we need to install the libraries for OpenCL:

   - if the GPU is from nvidia run:
	sudo apt-get install nvidia-opencl-dev
	sudo apt-get install nvidia-opencl-icd-331
	sudo apt-get install nvidia-current

   - if the PC has an intel graphic card integrated in the CPU, download the libraries from:
	https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-opencl

	Extract the files
	$ tar zxvf intel_sdk_ ...
	
	Convert the rpm package to debian package
	$ fakeroot alien --to-deb opencl-1.2-intel-cpu- ...

	Install the package
	$ sudo dpkg -i opencl
	
	After the installation be sure that the libraries are in:
	/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
	If not, you should link the library using 
	$ sudo ln -s /where_the_library_is/libOpenCL.so	/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenCL.so

3. Keep in mind that we have to use the files "cl.h" and "cl.hpp" from the version 1.1 of OpenCL, because there is a bug with the version 1.2

This is the web page of the headers:
https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/

The headers have to be replaced in
/usr/include/CL 

4. If we are using the intel_CPU for the graphics, we have to hack the "libfreenect2":
cd /libfreenect2/src/opencl_depth_packet_processor.cpp

and change line 246
context = cl::Context(CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU, properties);
by:
context = cl::Context(CL_DEVICE_TYPE_ALL, properties);

make the same in 
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/iai_kinect2-master/kinect2_bridge/src/kinect2_bridge.cpp
change in line 278
